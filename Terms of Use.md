# Beagle Terms of Use Agreement
Version 7th of March 2024

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the Terms of Use for Beagle and its associated models (collectively referred to as "Beagle"). Beagle is developed to facilitate advanced analysis of astronomical data by the scientific community. Accessing or using Beagle signifies that the user agrees to be bound by these terms and conditions.

## 2. Usage Policy
### 2.1 Acceptance of Terms
The use of Beagle implies unconditional acceptance of the latest version of these terms of use, which are publicly available on our GitHub repository. Users are encouraged to review the terms periodically to ensure compliance with any updates or changes.
### 2.2 Publication and Acknowledgment
Beagle users agree to cite relevant publications in any work that used Beagle:
- Chevallard & Charlot (2016) [always];
- latest version of the Bruzual & Charlot (2003, Charlot & Bruzual, in preparation) stellar population synthesis code [always];
- Gutkin et al. (2016) [if using models for nebular emission];
- Calzetti et al. (1994) [if using ‘attenuation_type=calzetti’];
- Charlot & Fall (2000) [if using ‘attenuation_type=cf00’];
- Charlot & Fall (2000) and Chevallard et al.(2013) [if using ‘attenuation_type=ccww13_universal’].
### 2.3 Individual user registration
Each Beagle user shall register individually from the Beagle [homepage](https://www.iap.fr/beagle/). This enables us to communicate with Beagle users about any bug fix and new feature.

## 3. Disclaimer of Warranty
Beagle is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The authors do not guarantee that Beagle will be error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that the service is free of harmful components.

## 4. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liabilities, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with Beagle or the use or other dealings in Beagle.

## 5. Contributions and Modifications
Users are welcome to contribute to Beagle by submitting suggestions, enhancements, or code patches. However, by submitting contributions, users agree to grant the authors a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and sublicense any contributions.

## 6. Restrictions
### 6.1 Use Restrictions
Beagle shall not be used in any way that:
- Violates any local, state, national, or international law or regulation.
- Attempts to access the software or its related systems and networks in a manner that undermines the security or integrity of the data or the system.

### 6.2 Model Usage Restrictions
The models provided or accessible through Beagle may not be used in conjunction with any external software offering similar functionalities. This restriction is in place to ensure the integrity and unique value of Beagle within the scientific community.

## 7. Governing Law
These terms and conditions are governed by French law without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Users agree that any legal action or proceeding related to Beagle will be conducted exclusively in courts located in France.

## 8. Changes to Terms
The authors reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Users are encouraged to review the terms periodically for any changes. Continued use of Beagle after such changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
